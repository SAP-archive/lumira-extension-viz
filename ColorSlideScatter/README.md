Color Slider "scatter" chart
=======================
In this chart, we show a dimension on the Y axis, mapped against a measure on the X axis. A second dimension serves as labels, and a third becomes the color code.  The code is adapted (indirectly, via the Vanilla Scatter extension) from Mike Bostock's scatter plot at http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887118

Data file
---------
The data file is a random set of cities, ride-sharing aplications, and car types.  It has no basis in reality and is simply meant to represent three uncorrelated dimensions. 

Prior version/current version
