This visualization extension for SAP Lumira is a chart that categorizes employees based on their performance level and potential for growth. It is built on top of an existing extension: [SWOT Analysis](https://github.com/SAP/lumira-extension-viz/tree/master/SWOT_Analysis) by [Wendy (Xin Win)](http://scn.sap.com/people/wendy.xin.wen) and showcases modifying open-source SAP Lumira visualization extensions to fit a specific need. 

Each box is a category made up of a performance metric from the X-axis, and potential metric from the Y-axis. The boxes contain a list of employees fitting the respective category, and the percentage of the total employees. Clicking on a box will display the information for just its category.
