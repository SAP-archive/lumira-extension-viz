What is it?
-----------

SAP
Lumira is SAP’s self-service analytics and visualization tool. SAP Lumira can
be downloaded as a personal edition for free from saplumira.com (or purchased
for enterprise usage). It allows to import data (local, DB, BI and more),
prepare and cleanse it, visualize and finally publish & share the data in
form of ‘stories’ and ‘info graphics’.

SAP delivers various visualizations out of the box (e.g., bar & bubble charts,
cloud tags and many more). 

SAP Lumira comes with an SDK. This lets you build custom extensions, which is
typically done for specific use cases. Extensions built that way are simply
copied into the folder structure of an SAP Lumira installation (desktop or
server), and can then be used.
