#ABC Analysis

ABC Analysis is an inventory categorization technique that divides items into 3 categories: A, B, and C. A items are the most significant: making up the top ~70-80% of the inventory value and only ~10-20% of the total items. B items make up ~15-25% of the value and ~30% of the items, and C items are the least important: making up ~5% of the value and ~50% of the items. This technique allows managers to determine which inventory items should be tracked very closely, and which can be more loosely controlled

This extension is built on top of an existing one: [Extended Bar Chart](https://github.com/SAP/lumira-extension-viz/tree/master/Extended_Bar_Chart) by [Jay Thoden van Velzen](https://people.sap.com/jay.thodenvanvelzen) and showcases modifying open-source SAP Lumira visualization extensions to fit a specific need. The chart shows the percentage of total items each classification comprises on the x-axis (represented by the width of the bars), and the percentage of the inventory value on the y-axis (represented by the height of the bars). Hovering on a bar will render a tooltip that shows the approximate percentages.

##Files
<ul>
	<li>
		SAP Lumira extension: <code>sap.viz.ext.abcanalysis.zip</code>
	</li>
	<li>
		Sample data: <code>abc-analysis.csv</code> or <code>abc-analysis2.csv</code>
	</li>
	<li>ABC Analysis excel file (for you to create your own dataset!): 	<code>create-abc-analysis.xlsx</code>
		<p>Just add rows with the item’s id (if applicable), the item’s cost per unit, and the annual demand for the item. The Excel sheet will calculate the annual cost for each item, total cost of the inventory, and each item’s value as a percentage. Lastly, in the “classification” column you need to label each item as A, B, or C. To do this, I recommend sorting the table rows by descending usage value. Then label the items as close as you see fit to the criteria for each classification: A items making up the top ~70-80% of the value, B items the middle ~15-25%, and C items the bottom ~5%.</p>
